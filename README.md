# **Angles: Architecture Blog**

Angles is a fictional architecture blog. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path), has been an invaluable exercise in enhancing my knowledge on the application of CSS grid.

## Project Prompt

In this project, you’ll follow step-by-step instructions to build an avant-garde website using the CSS Grid Layout.

You can view a live version of this project [here](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/learn-css-grid/project-iii/index.html).

Look over index.html to review the different HTML elements you have to work with, then navigate to style.css.

Notice that each section of the website has 3 elements — an image, a title, and a subtitle, and they go in alphabetical order, so image a goes with title b and subtitle c, and so forth.

If you want your final product to match ours exactly, follow the steps below very carefully. However, this is your project! You should feel free to experiment with placing the overlapping elements wherever you wish so that you can get more practice with CSS Grid Layout.
